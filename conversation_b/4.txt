That hung for several minutes on line 24 until I force quit Rstudio. Are you sure t-SNE is being performed only on the data corresponding to gene/protein expression and not experimental metadata?

You're correct; I overlooked that. Let me fix that for you. Here's the revised script:
[code version 4]
This script should now correctly perform t-SNE only on the gene/protein expression data and not the experimental metadata. Make sure to replace "path_to_your_directory/data" with the actual path to your directory containing the CSV files. Let me know if you need further assistance!
