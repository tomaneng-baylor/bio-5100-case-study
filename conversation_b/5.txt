I tried this code and the same error was thrown; could you make sure the first column, which specifies cell id, is not included in the dimensionality reduction either?'

Sure, I'll make sure to exclude the first column (cell id) from the dimensionality reduction. Here's the corrected script:
[code version 5]
This script should correctly exclude the "cell id" column from the dimensionality reduction. Make sure to replace "path_to_your_directory/data" with the actual path to your directory containing the CSV files. Let me know if you need further assistance!
