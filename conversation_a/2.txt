Sure, I'll adjust the code to account for the specific column name of the cell IDs. Here's the updated code:

This code should correctly handle the cell ID column with the name "b.cell.id". Make sure to replace "your_data_file.txt" with the path to your data file.

Let me know if you need further assistance!
