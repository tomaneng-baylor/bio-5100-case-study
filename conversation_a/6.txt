Ah, sorry. The data example I originally gave you was from when I was viewing it in LibreOffice. Here's a couple lines straight from a data file:

Got it, thank you for providing the actual data format. Let's adjust the code accordingly:

This code assumes that your data is comma-separated. If it's tab-separated, you can use read.delim() instead of read.csv() as we did before.

Let me know if this works for you!
