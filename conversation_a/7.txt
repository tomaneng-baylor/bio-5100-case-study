Beautiful! I'm going to give you some more information so you can extend this code to be more useful for my analysis. Let's start with the file names: 
sgCntrl collagen I_normalized.csv
sgCntrl fibronectin_normalized.csv
sgCntrl plastic_normalized.csv
sgRAI14(3)-6 collagen I_normalized.csv
sgRAI14(3)-6 fibronectin_normalized.csv
sgRAI14(3)-6 plastic_normalized.csv
sgRAI14(3) collagen I_normalized.csv
sgRAI14(3) fibronectin_normalized.csv
sgRAI14(3) plastic_normalized.csv

The first word in each file name, beginning with sg, represents a derivative of the PANC1 pancreatic cancer cell line. This is followed by the substrate on which the cells were grown: "plastic" for uncoated wells, "fibronectin" for wells coated in the ECM protein fibronectin, and "collagen I" for wells coated in type I collagen. Would you like any clarification on this?

Thank you for providing the additional information. I'll update the code to include file names and group IDs based on the information you provided.
[code version 7]
This code will read all the data files, preprocess them, and combine them into a single data frame. The t-SNE visualization will show different cell groups colored according to the substrate on which they were grown.

Let me know if you need further assistance!
