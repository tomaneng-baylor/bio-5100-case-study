The error has not been resolved still, so I ran through the code line by line. The first sign that something is wrong appears when I view the data in Rstudio as it appears after running line 6. Everything's in one column. Are you using the correct parameters for reading in the data?

Apologies for the oversight. It seems like I didn't set the correct separator for reading the data. Let me correct that for you:
[code version 5]
This time, I added sep = "\t" to read.delim() function to specify that the data is tab-separated. Let me know if this resolves the issue!
