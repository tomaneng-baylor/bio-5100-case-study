The error is unchanged (and the ggplot call looks the same to me too), but I think we can revisit the legend later. Below, I'll paste in the code snippet you sent that I'd like to use as a base for now. I'd like to also run k-means clustering on these data. Can you do that and map color to the cluster IDs in the t-SNE plot?

To include k-means clustering and map colors to cluster IDs in the t-SNE plot, we can follow these steps:

    Perform k-means clustering on the t-SNE-transformed data.
    Add the cluster IDs to the tsne_data data frame.
    Map colors to cluster IDs in the ggplot.

Here's how you can do it:

This code will perform k-means clustering on the t-SNE-transformed data and map colors to cluster IDs in the ggplot. Let me know if it works for you!
