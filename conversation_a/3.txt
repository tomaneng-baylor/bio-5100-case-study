Okay, I ran the code and it threw an error. I have an idea of why this happened and an idea for a fix, but why don't you tell me what you think first:

Error in terms.formula(object, data = data) : 
  '.' in formula and no 'data' argument
ChatGPT

The error you're encountering indicates that there's an issue with the formula provided to ggplot. This usually occurs when the data argument is not correctly specified.

Let's try modifying the ggplot call to explicitly specify the data argument. Here's the updated code:
[code version 3]
This modification explicitly specifies the data argument within the ggplot call. Try running this code and let me know if it works!
