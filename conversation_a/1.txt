Here is the experiment description: Three types of pancreatic cancer cells, which were each derived from one parental pancreatic cancer cell line, were fixed onto a well plate and stained for a variety of different proteins of interest using fluorophore-conjugated antibodies. Cyclic immunofluorescence was used to get images of cells stained with a total of 15 different antibodies.

My description of the data processing done thus far will be described next.
ChatGPT

Thank you for the experiment description. Please go ahead and describe the data processing steps that have been performed so far. Once I understand how the data has been processed, I'll be able to assist you further with your analysis.

All values of zero within the data were replaced with one. Then, the base 2 logarithm of each value was calculated. The resulting log2 output was then centered around the median by subtracting the median log2 value from everything.

Thank you for providing the data processing steps. It seems like you've preprocessed the data by replacing zero values with one, taking the base 2 logarithm of each value, and then centering the resulting log2-transformed values around the median.

Now, could you please describe the current format of the data? Specifically, how are the samples (cells), features (proteins), and their respective expression levels represented in the data? Additionally, do you have any information about the dimensions of the data matrix?
User
I'll provide you with an example. Let me know if you want further clarification.
ChatGPT

That would be great. Please provide an example of how the data is currently structured, and I'll be able to better understand the format and dimensions of the data.

Thank you for providing the example. Based on the provided example, it seems that the data is structured as follows:

    Each row represents a cell.
    The first column contains the unique identifier for each cell.
    The subsequent columns contain the expression levels of different proteins of interest (e.g., p-S6, PD-L1, Mcl1).

The expression levels have been transformed using the following steps:

    Replacing zero values with one.
    Taking the base 2 logarithm of each value.
    Centering the resulting log2-transformed values around the median.

Is my understanding correct? If so, I can proceed with the analysis.
User
Your understanding is correct
ChatGPT

Great, thank you for confirming.

Now, let's proceed with the analysis. Given the preprocessed data, we can perform clustering and dimensionality reduction to explore the relationships between the different pancreatic cancer cell types based on the expression levels of the proteins of interest.

    Clustering: We can use clustering algorithms such as K-means clustering or hierarchical clustering to identify groups of cells with similar expression profiles.

    Dimensionality Reduction: Techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) can be used to visualize the high-dimensional data in lower dimensions while preserving the structure of the data.

Could you please specify which analysis you would like to perform first, or if you have any specific questions regarding the analysis?
User
Please generate R code which takes data structured in the manner previously described and generates a t-distrbuted stochastic neighbor embedding visualization using ggplot2.
