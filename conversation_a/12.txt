OK. Here's the error I mentioned, since it showed up again:
Error in `geom_point()` at PhD_classes/5100/iteration_current.R:68:1:
! Problem while computing aesthetics.
â„¹ Error occurred in the 1st layer.
Caused by error:
! object 'group_id' not found
Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred

Apologies for the oversight. It seems I forgot to rename the group_id variable to group_id in the ggplot() call. Let me correct that:
[code version 12]
This should fix the error. Let me know if it works now!
